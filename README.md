## My VS Code–Themed Portfolio

A modern, animated portfolio that looks and feels like Visual Studio Code. It showcases my work, skills, and experience in a developer‑friendly interface with tabs, a file explorer, terminal‑styled panels, and a status bar.

### What you’ll find
- **VS Code interface**: Explorer, tabs, terminal‑styled panels, and status bar
- **Smooth animations**: Subtle motion that keeps the focus on content
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Clear sections**: About, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact
